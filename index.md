The **Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM)** workshop has been running annually at MICCAI since 2010. The 15th edition of STACOM workshop is going to be held in conjunction with the [MICCAI 2024](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/) in Marrakesh, Morocco. The STACOM workshop is aiming to create a collaborative forum for young/senior researchers (engineers, biophysicists, mathematicians) and clinicians, working on: statistical analysis of cardiac morphology and dynamics, computational modelling of the heart and fluid dynamics, data/models sharing, personalisation of cardiac electro-mechanical models, quantitative image analysis and translational methods into clinical practice.

## Challenges

{% include challenge.html 
title="Cardiac MRI Reconstruction Challenge" 
url="https://cmrxrecon.github.io/2024/Home.html"
image="/images/CMRxRecon-Poster 2024.jpg"
description="The objective of establishing the Cardiac MRI Reconstruction challenge is to provide a benchmark that enables the broader research community to contribute to the important work of accelerated CMR imaging with universal approaches that allow more diverse applications and better performance in real-world deployment in various environments. There are two tasks in this challenge: *multi-contrast CMR reconstruction* and *random sampling CMR reconstruction*." %}

title="Multiclass Bi-Atrial Segmentation Challenge" 
url="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18516" 
image="/images/mbas2024.png" 
description="Building from the 2018 left atrium challenge, this Multi-class Bi-Atrial Segmentation (MBAS) challenge broadens to include both left and right atriums as well as their walls, focusing on multi-class machine learning from LGE-MRIs to enhance ablation for atrial fibrillation patients. The challenge objective is to benchmark methods for segmentation and biomarker identification, such as atrium volume and fibrosis, using 200 multi-center 3D LGE-MRIs with each scan meticulously labelled by three experts." %}
