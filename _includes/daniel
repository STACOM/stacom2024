Title: *AI for image reconstruction, super-resolution and analysis*<br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing many fields across science and our society. This talk will discuss how AI is changing medicine and healthcare, particularly in radiology. I will focus on how AI can support the acquisition of medical images and image analysis and interpretation. This can enable the early detection of diseases and support the improved personalised diagnosis. I will show several examples of this in the talk, including cardiovascular MR imaging.<br><br>Short bio:<br>![image]({{ "/images/DanielRueckert.jpg" | relative_url }}){: style="float:left; width:150px; margin-right:10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 1px; border-radius: 50%;"} Daniel Rueckert is an Alexander von Humboldt Professor for AI in Medicine and Healthcare at the Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, where he is also Director of the Institute for AI and Informatics in Medicine.
